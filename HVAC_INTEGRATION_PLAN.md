# HVAC CRM Integration Plan
## Twenty CRM + HVAC FastAPI Backend Integration

### Overview
This document outlines the strategy to integrate Twenty CRM frontend with our existing HVAC FastAPI backend, creating a legendary HVAC-specific CRM template that combines modern UI/UX with specialized HVAC business logic.

### Architecture Strategy

#### 1. Hybrid Backend Approach
- **Keep Twenty CRM GraphQL API** for standard CRM operations (companies, people, opportunities)
- **Extend with HVAC FastAPI** for specialized HVAC functionality
- **Create API Gateway/Proxy** to route requests appropriately

#### 2. Data Model Mapping

##### Standard Objects → HVAC Entities
```
Twenty CRM          →  HVAC Backend
Company             →  Customer (with NIP, REGON)
Person              →  Contact
Opportunity         →  Service Quote/Estimate
Task                →  Service Ticket
Note                →  Service Notes
Attachment          →  Equipment Photos/Documents
```

##### New HVAC-Specific Objects
```
Equipment           →  HVAC Equipment (boilers, AC units, etc.)
ServiceTicket       →  Maintenance/Repair tickets
MaintenanceSchedule →  Preventive maintenance
TechnicalSpecs      →  Equipment specifications
ServiceHistory      →  Complete service timeline
```

#### 3. API Integration Points

##### Frontend API Calls
```typescript
// Standard CRM operations → Twenty GraphQL
- Customer management
- Contact management  
- Basic opportunities
- Notes and attachments

// HVAC-specific operations → FastAPI

     type: 'maintenance' | 'repair' | 'installation';
     priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'emergency';
     status: 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
     assignedTechnician: string;
     scheduledDate: Date;
     description: string;
     diagnosis: string;
     resolution: string;
     partsUsed: Part[];
     laborHours: number;
     totalCost: number;
   }
   ```

3. **Polish Business Compliance**
   ```typescript
   interface PolishCustomer extends Customer {
     nip: string;           // Tax identification number
     regon: string;         // Statistical number
     krs?: string;          // Court register number
     vatRate: number;       // VAT rate
     paymentTerms: number;  // Payment terms in days
   }
   ```

#### Phase 3: AI and Semantic Features

    if (this.isHVACSpecific(request)) {
      return this.forwardToHVACAPI(request);
    }
    return this.forwardToTwentyAPI(request);
  }
}
```

```typescript
// sync.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class DataSyncService {
  async syncCustomer(customerId: string): Promise<void> {

    const hvacCustomer = await this.hvacAPI.getCustomer(customerId);
    
    // Merge and sync data
    await this.mergeCustomerData(twentyCustomer, hvacCustomer);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Frontend Integration
```typescript
// hvac-api.service.ts
export class HVACAPIService {
  async getEquipment(customerId: string): Promise<Equipment[]> {
    return this.http.get(`/api/v1/customers/${customerId}/equipment`);
  }
